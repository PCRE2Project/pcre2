.SH NAME
PCRE2 - Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.rs
.sp
.B #include <pcre2.h>
.PP
.nf
.B pcre2_code *pcre2_code_copy_with_tables(const pcre2_code *\fIcode\fP);
.fi
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.rs
.sp
This function makes a copy of the memory used for a compiled pattern, excluding
any memory used by the JIT compiler. Without a subsequent call to
\fBpcre2_jit_compile()\fP, the copy can be used only for non-JIT matching.
Unlike \fBpcre2_code_copy()\fP, a separate copy of the character tables is also
made, with the new code pointing to it. This memory will be automatically freed
when \fBpcre2_code_free()\fP is called. The yield of the function is NULL if
\fIcode\fP is NULL or if sufficient memory cannot be obtained.

page and a description of the POSIX API in the
