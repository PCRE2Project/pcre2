<br><a name="SEC1" href="#TOC1">PCRE2 REGULAR EXPRESSION SYNTAX SUMMARY</a><br>
<P>
The full syntax and semantics of the regular expressions that are supported by
PCRE2 are described in the
<a href="pcre2pattern.html"><b>pcre2pattern</b></a>
documentation. This document contains a quick-reference summary of the syntax.
</P>
<br><a name="SEC2" href="#TOC1">QUOTING</a><br>
<P>
<pre>
  \x         where x is non-alphanumeric is a literal x
  \Q...\E    treat enclosed characters as literal
</pre>
Note that white space inside \Q...\E is always treated as literal, even if
PCRE2_EXTENDED is set, causing most other white space to be ignored.
</P>
<br><a name="SEC3" href="#TOC1">BRACED ITEMS</a><br>
<P>
With one exception, wherever brace characters { and } are required to enclose
data for constructions such as \g{2} or \k{name}, space and/or horizontal tab
characters that follow { or precede } are allowed and are ignored. In the case
of quantifiers, they may also appear before or after the comma. The exception
is \u{...} which is not Perl-compatible and is recognized only when
PCRE2_EXTRA_ALT_BSUX is set. This is an ECMAScript compatibility feature, and
follows ECMAScript's behaviour.
</P>
<br><a name="SEC4" href="#TOC1">ESCAPED CHARACTERS</a><br>
<P>
This table applies to ASCII and Unicode environments. An unrecognized escape
sequence causes an error.
<pre>
  \a         alarm, that is, the BEL character (hex 07)
  \cx        "control-x", where x is a non-control ASCII character
  \e         escape (hex 1B)
  \f         form feed (hex 0C)
  \n         newline (hex 0A)
  \r         carriage return (hex 0D)
  \t         tab (hex 09)
  \0dd       character with octal code 0dd
  \ddd       character with octal code ddd, or backreference
  \o{ddd..}  character with octal code ddd..
  \N{U+hh..} character with Unicode code point hh.. (Unicode mode only)
  \xhh       character with hex code hh
  \x{hh..}   character with hex code hh..
</pre>
If PCRE2_ALT_BSUX or PCRE2_EXTRA_ALT_BSUX is set ("ALT_BSUX mode"), the
following are also recognized:
<pre>
  \U         the character "U"
  \uhhhh     character with hex code hhhh
  \u{hh..}   character with hex code hh.. but only for EXTRA_ALT_BSUX
</pre>
When \x is not followed by {, from zero to two hexadecimal digits are read,
but in ALT_BSUX mode \x must be followed by two hexadecimal digits to be
recognized as a hexadecimal escape; otherwise it matches a literal "x".
Likewise, if \u (in ALT_BSUX mode) is not followed by four hexadecimal digits
or (in EXTRA_ALT_BSUX mode) a sequence of hex digits in curly brackets, it
matches a literal "u".
</P>
<P>
Note that \0dd is always an octal code. The treatment of backslash followed by
a non-zero digit is complicated; for details see the section
<a href="pcre2pattern.html#digitsafterbackslash">"Non-printing characters"</a>
in the
<a href="pcre2pattern.html"><b>pcre2pattern</b></a>
documentation, where details of escape processing in EBCDIC environments are
also given. \N{U+hh..} is synonymous with \x{hh..} in PCRE2 but is not
supported in EBCDIC environments. Note that \N not followed by an opening
curly bracket has a different meaning (see below).
</P>
<br><a name="SEC5" href="#TOC1">CHARACTER TYPES</a><br>
<P>
<pre>
  .          any character except newline;
               in dotall mode, any character whatsoever
  \C         one code unit, even in UTF mode (best avoided)
  \d         a decimal digit
  \D         a character that is not a decimal digit
  \h         a horizontal white space character
  \H         a character that is not a horizontal white space character
  \N         a character that is not a newline
  \p{<i>xx</i>}     a character with the <i>xx</i> property
  \P{<i>xx</i>}     a character without the <i>xx</i> property
  \R         a newline sequence
  \s         a white space character
  \S         a character that is not a white space character
  \v         a vertical white space character
  \V         a character that is not a vertical white space character
  \w         a "word" character
  \W         a "non-word" character
  \X         a Unicode extended grapheme cluster
</pre>
\C is dangerous because it may leave the current matching point in the middle
of a UTF-8 or UTF-16 character. The application can lock out the use of \C by
setting the PCRE2_NEVER_BACKSLASH_C option. It is also possible to build PCRE2
with the use of \C permanently disabled.
</P>
<P>
By default, \d, \s, and \w match only ASCII characters, even in UTF-8 mode
or in the 16-bit and 32-bit libraries. However, if locale-specific matching is
happening, \s and \w may also match characters with code points in the range
128-255. If the PCRE2_UCP option is set, the behaviour of these escape
sequences is changed to use Unicode properties and they match many more
characters, but there are some option settings that can restrict individual
sequences to matching only ASCII characters.
</P>
<P>
Property descriptions in \p and \P are matched caselessly; hyphens,
underscores, and white space are ignored, in accordance with Unicode's "loose
matching" rules.

Unicode defines a number of binary properties, that is, properties whose only
values are true or false. You can obtain a list of those that are recognized by
\p and \P, along with their abbreviations, by running this command:

Many script names and their 4-letter abbreviations are recognized in
\p{sc:...} or \p{scx:...} items, or on their own with \p (and also \P of
course). You can obtain a list of these scripts by running this command:

mixture of setting and unsetting such as (?i-x) is allowed, but there may be
only one hyphen. Setting (but no unsetting) is allowed after (?^ for example
(?^in). An option setting may appear at the start of a non-capture group, for

<br><a name="SEC28" href="#TOC1">BACKTRACKING CONTROL</a><br>
<P>
All backtracking control verbs may be in the form (*VERB:NAME). For (*MARK) the
name is mandatory, for the others it is optional. (*SKIP) changes its behaviour
if :NAME is present. The others just set a name for passing back to the caller,
but this is not a name that (*SKIP) can see. The following act immediately they
are reached:
<pre>
  (*ACCEPT)       force successful match
  (*FAIL)         force backtrack; synonym (*F)
  (*MARK:NAME)    set name to be passed back; synonym (*:NAME)
</pre>
The following act only when a subsequent match failure causes a backtrack to
reach them. They all force a match failure, but they differ in what happens
afterwards. Those that advance the start-of-match point do so only if the
pattern is not anchored.
<pre>
  (*COMMIT)       overall failure, no advance of starting point
  (*PRUNE)        advance to next starting character
  (*SKIP)         advance to current matching position
  (*SKIP:NAME)    advance to position corresponding to an earlier
                  (*MARK:NAME); if not found, the (*SKIP) is ignored
  (*THEN)         local failure, backtrack to next alternation
</pre>
The effect of one of these verbs in a group called as a subroutine is confined
to the subroutine call.
</P>
<br><a name="SEC29" href="#TOC1">CALLOUTS</a><br>

  (?C)            callout (assumed number 0)
  (?Cn)           callout with numerical data n

</pre>
The allowed string delimiters are ` ' " ^ % # $ (which are the same for the
start and the end), and the starting delimiter { matched with the ending
delimiter }. To encode the ending delimiter within the string, double it.
