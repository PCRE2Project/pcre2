After a call of \fBpcre2_match()\fP that was passed the match block that is
this function's argument, this function returns a pointer to the last (*MARK),
(*PRUNE), or (*THEN) name that was encountered during the matching process. The
name is zero-terminated, and is within the compiled pattern. The length of the
name is in the preceding code unit. If no name is available, NULL is returned.

After a successful match, the name that is returned is the last one on the
matching path. After a failed match or a partial match, the last encountered
name is returned.
