.SH NAME
PCRE2 - Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.rs
.sp
.B #include <pcre2.h>
.PP
.nf
.B pcre2_match_data *pcre2_match_data_create_from_pattern(
.B "  const pcre2_code *\fIcode\fP, pcre2_general_context *\fIgcontext\fP);"
.fi
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.rs
.sp
This function creates a new match data block for holding the result of a match.
The first argument points to a compiled pattern. The number of capturing
parentheses within the pattern is used to compute the number of pairs of
offsets that are required in the match data block. These form the "output
vector" (ovector) within the match data block, and are used to identify the
matched string and any captured substrings when matching with
\fBpcre2_match()\fP. If you are using \fBpcre2_dfa_match()\fP, which uses the
outut vector in a different way, you should use \fBpcre2_match_data_create()\fP
instead of this function.
.P
The second argument points to a general context, for custom memory management,
or is NULL to use the same memory allocator as was used for the compiled
pattern. The result of the function is NULL if the memory for the block could
not be obtained.
