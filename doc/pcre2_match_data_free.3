.TH PCRE2_MATCH_DATA_FREE 3 "18 January 2023" "PCRE2 10.43"
.SH NAME
PCRE2 - Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.rs
.sp
.B #include <pcre2.h>
.PP
.nf
.B void pcre2_match_data_free(pcre2_match_data *\fImatch_data\fP);
.fi
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.rs
.sp
If \fImatch_data\fP is NULL, this function does nothing. Otherwise,
\fImatch_data\fP must point to a match data block, which this function frees,
using the memory freeing function from the general context or compiled pattern
with which it was created, or \fBfree()\fP if that was not set. If the match
data block was previously passed to \fBpcre2_match()\fP, it will have an
attached heapframe vector; this is also freed.
.P
If the PCRE2_COPY_MATCHED_SUBJECT was used for a successful match using this
match data block, the copy of the subject that was referenced within the block
is also freed.
.P
There is a complete description of the PCRE2 native API in the
.\" HREF
\fBpcre2api\fP
.\"
page and a description of the POSIX API in the
.\" HREF
\fBpcre2posix\fP
.\"
page.
