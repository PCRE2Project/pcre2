/*************************************************
*           PCRE2 DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM          *
*************************************************/

/* This is a demonstration program to illustrate a straightforward way of
using the PCRE2 regular expression library from a C program. See the
pcre2sample documentation for a short discussion ("man pcre2sample" if you have
the PCRE2 man pages installed). PCRE2 is a revised API for the library, and is
incompatible with the original PCRE API.

There are actually three libraries, each supporting a different code unit
width. This demonstration program uses the 8-bit library. The default is to
process each code unit as a separate character, but if the pattern begins with
"(*UTF)", both it and the subject are treated as UTF-8 strings, where
characters may occupy multiple code units.

In Unix-like environments, if PCRE2 is installed in your standard system
libraries, you should be able to compile this program using this command:

cc -Wall pcre2demo.c -lpcre2-8 -o pcre2demo

If PCRE2 is not installed in a standard place, it is likely to be installed
with support for the pkg-config mechanism. If you have pkg-config, you can
compile this program using this command:

cc -Wall pcre2demo.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs libpcre2-8` -o pcre2demo

If you do not have pkg-config, you may have to use something like this:

cc -Wall pcre2demo.c -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib \e
  -R/usr/local/lib -lpcre2-8 -o pcre2demo

Replace "/usr/local/include" and "/usr/local/lib" with wherever the include and
library files for PCRE2 are installed on your system. Only some operating
systems (Solaris is one) use the -R option.

Building under Windows:

If you want to statically link this program against a non-dll .a file, you must
define PCRE2_STATIC before including pcre2.h, so in this environment, uncomment
the following line. */

/* #define PCRE2_STATIC */

/* The PCRE2_CODE_UNIT_WIDTH macro must be defined before including pcre2.h.
For a program that uses only one code unit width, setting it to 8, 16, or 32
makes it possible to use generic function names such as pcre2_compile(). Note
that just changing 8 to 16 (for example) is not sufficient to convert this
program to process 16-bit characters. Even in a fully 16-bit environment, where
string-handling functions such as strcmp() and printf() work with 16-bit
characters, the code for handling the table of named substrings will still need
to be modified. */
