+The code below was created for 10.33 (see ChangeLog 10.33 #4) when the
+POSIX functions were given pcre2_... names instead of the traditional POSIX 
+names. However, it has proved to be more troublesome than useful. There have
+been at least two cases where a program links with two others, one of which
+uses the POSIX library and the other uses the PCRE2 POSIX functions, thus
+causing two instances of the POSIX runctions to exist, leading to trouble. For
+10.37 this code is commented out. In due course it can be removed if there are
+no issues. The only small worry is the comment below about languages that do 
+not include pcre2posix.h. If there are any such cases, they will have to use
+the PCRE2 names.
